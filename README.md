# TwitterApp
Simple Twitter Client App Showing followers, profile for every follower and some tweets


Note: App idea 
(API Folder) App use Facade pattern to manage all api task like persistance, networking, authentication,etc........
(Persistance Folder) singleton pattern so we have one instance to manage all database operation....
(Localization Folder) for change app language 
(Some helpful extension for smalling code complexity)
(Model Folder contain all my project models).....
(helper, constant, classes to make some helper methods that implement quick operation and came back with result....)

how to use app 
open app login with your twitter account you should see all followers, if you scroll you will load 10 followers 10 , per page...
if you pull to refresh you will refresh table view and load all followers again

if you tab on any follower a page will open with that follower information and and images,
if you click on banner image or profle it will open i. scroll View will zoom capability.............
Note: important :
1. to hide zoom image you should back it to default zoom size then swipe up it will hide in nice simple animation..........
2. to save followers to data base you show terminate app from device 
if you open it from simulator, you shold close app from simulator to save 
if from scode it wouldn't save because application will trimnate function wouldn't call......
